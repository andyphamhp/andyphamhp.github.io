            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Fencing is a combat sport that features sword fighting. The three disciplines of modern fencing are the foil, the épée, and the sabre. Each discipline uses a different kind of blade and has its own rules.</p>

                    <p>A light cutting and thrusting weapon that targets the entire body above the waist. Sabre is unique for its use of right of way rules and its fast-paced, slashing actions.</p>

                <li>Points are scored by making contact with an opponent's valid target area</li>
                <li>In foil and sabre, there is a rule of "right of way" that determines who gets the point</li>
                <li>Épée has no right of way rule - the first fencer to score a hit gets the point</li>

            <h2>Right of Way (Priority) Principles in Sabre</h2>
            <article class="article-content">
                <p>Sabre (like foil) uses Right of Way (priority) conventions to decide which fencer's hit earns the point when both might land. The referee alone decides the validity or priority of touches by applying these conventions. In simple terms, the fencer who initiates a correct attack first has the priority, and the opponent must defend (parry or evade) or risk being hit without score. If both fencers hit simultaneously and the referee cannot determine a priority (i.e. truly simultaneous action), no point is awarded. The concept of right of way rewards the fencer who properly takes the initiative and forces the opponent to react.</p>

                <h3>Key Sabre Priority Rules</h3>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Continuous Attack</h4>
                    <p>"Any attack properly executed must be parried or completely avoided, and the phrase must be continuous." This means once a valid attack begins, it retains priority until it either lands, misses, or is parried/evaded; the attacker should not interrupt the flow. If the attacker hesitates, pulls their arm back, or stops, the attack is considered finished (broken), and priority can pass to the opponent.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Definition of Attack</h4>
                    <p>An attack is a continuous offensive action initiated by extending the weapon and threatening the opponent's target. According to FIE rule t.101, "The attack is correctly carried out when the straightening of the arm, with the point or cutting edge continuously threatening the valid target, precedes the initiation of the lunge."</p>
                    <p>In other words, to have a true attack (with priority) in sabre, the fencer must extend their arm and weapon toward target before or as they push off to lunge or advance-lunge. If a sabreur merely rushes forward without extending (blade not threatening), that forward movement is considered preparation, not a real attack – and the opponent can seize priority by launching their own attack into that preparation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Attack with Lunge vs. Step-Forward Lunge</h4>
                    <p>In sabre, attacks often involve a step-forward then lunge. The rules clarify that in a step-lunge attack, the extension must begin before or as the front foot moves. Specifically, a simple attack with a lunge is correctly executed if the arm straightens before the front foot lands, and a step-lunge attack is correct if the arm begins straightening before or as the front foot step and the hit arrives by the time the front foot lands in the lunge.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Compound Attacks</h4>
                    <p>These are attacks with one or more feints (pretended attacks) before the final strike. Feints do not confer priority by themselves; they are intended to draw a reaction. A compound attack is only valid if the feints are executed with a threatening weapon posture.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Point in Line</h4>
                    <p>A point in line is a specific defensive posture where a fencer extends the arm and blade straight toward the opponent, establishing a continuous threat before any attack begins. In sabre, if a fencer has established point-in-line, the opponent must remove or deflect the line before attacking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>The Parry and Riposte</h4>
                    <p>A parry is a defensive action where the fencer blocks or deflects the opponent's blade. A successful parry takes away the attacker's right of way and gives the priority to the defender, who may immediately strike back with a riposte.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Attack on the Blade (Beat or Take)</h4>
                    <p>An attack can be preceded by a beat on the opponent's blade to gain priority, as long as the beat is properly done. In sabre, the rules distinguish between beats on different parts of the blade.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Illegal Actions (Priority Context)</h4>
                    <p>Some actions are forbidden outright in sabre, affecting scoring if they occur. Notably, the flèche attack (running attack where the rear leg crosses ahead of the front) is illegal in sabre. Any forward movement that causes the back foot to completely pass the front foot is penalized (Group 1) and any hit scored by the offending fencer is annulled.</p>
