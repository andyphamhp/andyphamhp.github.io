            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Fencing is a combat sport that features sword fighting. The three disciplines of modern fencing are the foil, the épée, and the sabre. Each discipline uses a different kind of blade and has its own rules.</p>

            <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fencers must salute each other and the referee at the beginning and end of the bout</li>
                <li>Points are scored by making contact with an opponent's valid target area</li>
                <li>In foil and sabre, there is a rule of "right of way" that determines who gets the point</li>
                <li>Épée has no right of way rule - the first fencer to score a hit gets the point</li>

            <h2>Right of Way (Priority) Principles in Sabre</h2>
            <article class="article-content">
                <p>Sabre (like foil) uses Right of Way (priority) conventions to decide which fencer's hit earns the point when both might land. The referee alone decides the validity or priority of touches by applying these conventions. In simple terms, the fencer who initiates a correct attack first has the priority, and the opponent must defend (parry or evade) or risk being hit without score. If both fencers hit simultaneously and the referee cannot determine a priority (i.e. truly simultaneous action), no point is awarded. The concept of right of way rewards the fencer who properly takes the initiative and forces the opponent to react.</p>

                <h3>Key Sabre Priority Rules</h3>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Continuous Attack</h4>
                    <p>"Any attack properly executed must be parried or completely avoided, and the phrase must be continuous." This means once a valid attack begins, it retains priority until it either lands, misses, or is parried/evaded; the attacker should not interrupt the flow. If the attacker hesitates, pulls their arm back, or stops, the attack is considered finished (broken), and priority can pass to the opponent.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Definition of Attack</h4>
                    <p>An attack is a continuous offensive action initiated by extending the weapon and threatening the opponent's target. According to FIE rule t.101, "The attack is correctly carried out when the straightening of the arm, with the point or cutting edge continuously threatening the valid target, precedes the initiation of the lunge."</p>
                    <p>In other words, to have a true attack (with priority) in sabre, the fencer must extend their arm and weapon toward target before or as they push off to lunge or advance-lunge. If a sabreur merely rushes forward without extending (blade not threatening), that forward movement is considered preparation, not a real attack – and the opponent can seize priority by launching their own attack into that preparation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Attack with Lunge vs. Step-Forward Lunge</h4>
                    <p>In sabre, attacks often involve a step-forward then lunge. The rules clarify that in a step-lunge attack, the extension must begin before or as the front foot moves. Specifically, a simple attack with a lunge is correctly executed if the arm straightens before the front foot lands, and a step-lunge attack is correct if the arm begins straightening before or as the front foot step and the hit arrives by the time the front foot lands in the lunge.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Compound Attacks</h4>
                    <p>These are attacks with one or more feints (pretended attacks) before the final strike. Feints do not confer priority by themselves; they are intended to draw a reaction. A compound attack is only valid if the feints are executed with a threatening weapon posture.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Point in Line</h4>
                    <p>A point in line is a specific defensive posture where a fencer extends the arm and blade straight toward the opponent, establishing a continuous threat before any attack begins. In sabre, if a fencer has established point-in-line, the opponent must remove or deflect the line before attacking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>The Parry and Riposte</h4>
                    <p>A parry is a defensive action where the fencer blocks or deflects the opponent's blade. A successful parry takes away the attacker's right of way and gives the priority to the defender, who may immediately strike back with a riposte.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Attack on the Blade (Beat or Take)</h4>
                    <p>An attack can be preceded by a beat on the opponent's blade to gain priority, as long as the beat is properly done. In sabre, the rules distinguish between beats on different parts of the blade.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Illegal Actions (Priority Context)</h4>
                    <p>Some actions are forbidden outright in sabre, affecting scoring if they occur. Notably, the flèche attack (running attack where the rear leg crosses ahead of the front) is illegal in sabre. Any forward movement that causes the back foot to completely pass the front foot is penalized (Group 1) and any hit scored by the offending fencer is annulled.</p>

            <h2>Referee Decision-Making: "The Phrase" and Priority Resolution</h2>
            <article class="article-content">
                <p>In sabre refereeing, each exchange of actions is called a phrase. The referee analyzes the phrase to determine which fencer had the right of way at the moment of any touch. When both fencers land touches, the referee must decide if it was a simultaneous action (no one had priority) or a double-touch situation where one fencer was at fault. The FIE rules (t.106) lay out specific scenarios to guide these calls.</p>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Truly Simultaneous Attacks – No Touch</h4>
                    <p>If the referee judges that both fencers initiated and completed their attacks at the same time, with no clear time separation or priority, it is ruled a simultaneous action. "When during a phrase both fencers are hit simultaneously… the hits exchanged are annulled for both fencers." In other words, no point is awarded and the fencers are reset on guard.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>One Attack Clearly After the Other</h4>
                    <p>If there was a clear time difference between hits (one light significantly before the other), the scoring apparatus will only show one light. In that case, priority is usually obvious (the one who hit first scores, unless their action was invalid/penalized).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Both Lights – Priority Rules</h4>
                    <p>When both red and green lights show (hits within the lockout interval), the referee applies the priority conventions to determine who earns the point. According to t.106, there are two sets of cases: those in which the fencer who was being attacked is at fault (so the attacker's touch stands), and those in which the attacker is at fault (so the defender's touch stands).</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Defender's Faults (Attacker Scores)</h3>
                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Stop-hit or Counter-attack Without Timing Advantage</h4>
                    <p>The defender tried to steal a touch with a counter-attack but the attacker's simple attack was continuous and landed – thus the defender is hit.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Evade Instead of Parry and Fail</h4>
                    <p>If the defender retreats or attempts to dodge the attack instead of parrying, and still gets hit, they have no right to the touch.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Delayed Riposte</h4>
                    <p>After a successful parry, the defender waits too long to riposte, allowing the attacker to renew. "If, after making a successful parry, he makes a momentary pause (delayed riposte) which gives his opponent the right to renew the attack (redoublement, remise or reprise)," then the defender is hit.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Attacker's Faults (Defender Scores)</h3>
                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Attack Into Established Line</h4>
                    <p>"If he initiated his attack when his opponent had his point in line… without deflecting the opponent's weapon," the attacker is hit. Failing to respect a point in line means the attack had no right of way.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Attack Misses the Opponent's Blade (Derobement)</h4>
                    <p>If the attacker tries to find or beat the defender's blade but fails because the defender avoids the contact (a dérobement), and the attacker continues their attack anyway, the attacker has no priority.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Compound Attack is Parried During a Feint</h4>
                    <p>If the attacker, during their compound attack, allows the opponent to find the blade during one of the feints, but the attacker still continues, the attacker loses the right of way.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Attack Pauses or Withdraws</h4>
                    <p>"If, during a compound attack, he bends his arm or makes a momentary pause, during which time the opponent makes a stop hit or an attack," the attacker is hit.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Stop-hit in Time Against the Compound Attack</h4>
                    <p>"If, during a compound attack, he is stop-hit one period of fencing time before he makes his final movement," the attacker is hit.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Remise After Being Parried</h4>
                    <p>"If he makes a hit by a remise, redoublement or reprise following a parry by his opponent which has been followed by a riposte which is immediate, simple and executed in one period of fencing time without withdrawing the arm."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-card summary">
                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>After a simultaneous exchange, the referee will assign the point to one side if that side clearly followed the conventions (e.g. had a valid attack) while the other committed one of the faults listed. Otherwise, if both seemed equal, no point.</p>
